  one candle for each year of her total age. When she blows out the candles, sheâ€™ll only be able 
  to blow out the tallest ones. Your task is to find out how many candles she can successfully blow out.

/* My Solution */
let birthdayCakeCandles = arr => {
  let maxHeight = arr[0];
  let count = 0;
  for (let i in arr) {
    if (arr[i] > maxHeight) {
      maxHeight = arr[i];
      count = 0;
      count += 1;
    } else if (arr[i] === maxHeight) {
      count += 1;
    }
  }
  return count;
};

let count = birthdayCakeCandles([1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2]);
console.log("count", count);

/* My Solution 1 */

  let maxHeight1 = arr[0];
  let count = arr.reduce((tempCount, val) => {
    if (val > maxHeight1) {
      maxHeight1 = val;

      tempCount += 1;
    } else if (val === maxHeight1) {

  }, 0);
  return count;
